# Part 1

## Worldwind tour of a Rails app and basic scaffolding.

1. Create new project: `rails new myapp`: kick off new rails app, installed files
  - __what "bundle installed" does?__
    > Create the required gems for the applications in the sandbox, allow us to use gemfile. 
  - __Why "database.yml" important?__
    > It tells the app that how to connect to the database

2. Relational database
  - 1:M association?
    > foreign keys on the many side
  - "_" in rails -- what ever the last thing returns
    * `Post.first` then `post = _` -> `post == Post.first

3. With ActiveRecord(AR), we can
  - Create in-memory Model objects: 
    * eg: `user = User.new(username: "ben", email: "ben@fake.com")`
  - Save to our database
    * `user.save`
    * `user = User.create(username: "Kris")`
  - Retrive Column Value
    * `user = User.find_by(username: "joe")`
    * user.email
