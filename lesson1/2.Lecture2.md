**form helpers**
  * useful when you are not working with an ActiveRecord model. This scenario comes up quite often in any webapp.
  * Model backed forms are useful when performing "CRUD" actions on a resource, and non-model backed form helpers are used 
    everywhere else. We'll get to use it in our application later when we implement authentication.
