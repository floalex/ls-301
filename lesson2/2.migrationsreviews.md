Migrations

- change to schemas
- data definition statements vs query statements
- setting db & creating migration
- rolling back
  * up/down methods
  * up: create table
  * down: drop table
  * will lose data 
- how Rails keep track of which migration have run? -- version
- when to modify a migration
  * Don't modify when you already pushed the migration to git
  * create a new migration to modify will be safer `rails generate migration renamemodel`
  * use `rename_column` in change method 
- what happens if can't run migration cleanly end to end
