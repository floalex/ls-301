== Getting Started

1. Make sure you have rails version 4. Type "rails -v" to make sure.
2. From this project directory, do "bundle install --without production"
3. To start the server "rails server".
4. Navigate your browser to localhost:3000.


== Setting up with Git

1. Instantiate this directory as a git repository with "git init".
2. Go to github.com, create a new repository, then follow instructions on how to add a remote repository that links to github.
3. Remember, you have to "git add" changes to ready it for a commit, then "git commit" to commit those changes locally, then "git push origin master" to push it to the remote "origin" repository, which is the previously created github.com repository.

== Deploying to Heroku

1. Download the Heroku Toolbelt.
2. Go to Heroku.com and register.
3. Issue "heroku login" to authenticate, with the credentials from previous step. Make sure it's a git repository, by issuing "git init", and also "git add", "git commit" your files.
4. Then "heroku create" to create this app on heroku. This command also adds a "heroku" remote repository that you can push to.
5. To deploy, issue "git push heroku master".
6. You may need to run migrations on heroku afterwards, with "heroku run rake db:migrate".
7. Other helpful heroku commands:
  - heroku logs
  - heroku logs -t
  - heroku rename
  - heroku restart
  - heroku run console
  - heroku help

== Step by Step how the project build

## 1. Set up Post model
  1. First, create a migration to modify the database. In this migration, we want 
     to create the table. Rails migrations are the only place where we want to use 
     generators. Issue this command from the terminal within your project directory: 
     `rails generate migration create_posts`
  2. Open the newly created migration file in your code editor, and take a look at 
     the migration file. Use the `create_table` method to create the necessary table 
     and columns. We want: a `url` and `title`, which should both be strings and a 
     `description` which should be text. Also `user_id` should be integer, `timestamps`
  3. From the terminal again, issue this command: `rake db:migrate` (you may need to 
     do rake db:create first, if you're using mysql or postgres). If you're getting 
     a rake error, you can try adding `bundle exec` before the rake command.
  4. Then take a look at your database and see that you have a posts table, with 
     three columns: url, title and description.
  5. Create a Post model file: under app/models directory, create a post.rb file 
     put `class Post < ActiveRecord::Base; end`
  6. Open rails console, and create your first Post object: 
     `Post.create(title: "My first post", description: "I sure hope this works!", url: "www.yahoo.com")` 
     Verify by looking at your database that this worked.

## 2. User model
  Same as the Post model, except the User model should have a username column of type string.

## 3. 1:M between User and Post
  two step process:
  1. First, we need to modify the database to create a new foreign key column on the posts table 
     to support the one to many association. Remember, the foreign key column always goes on the 'many' side.
     Hint: generate a migration file, then use Rails migration syntax to create a new column.
  2. Declare the associations in the models.
  
  * Verify that your associations are set up correctly.
    1. Create some data to populate the posts and users tables.
    2. Associate the data by setting the foreign key column in posts table with a user id.
    3. see if you can traverse the association:
    4. Example:
    ```
    post = Post.find(1)
    post.user
    post.user.username
    ```
## 4. Comment model
  Create a Comment model, with a body attribute to store the comment's text. 
  It can't be a "string" because strings have limited size restriction, so it has to be of type "text".
  Note that the Comment model has two associations:
    - one with the User model to track who created it
    - another with the Post model to track which post this comment is for.
    - need two 1:M associations

## 5. Comment associations
  Set up the two 1:M associations for the Comment model, and verify in rails console.
  - with User, to track who created the comment
  - with Post, to track what this comment is about

## 6. Category model
  The Category model should only have a name attribute.
    - `rails generate migration create_categories`
    - add name in string and timestamps in the table

## 7. M:M between Post and Category
  Use "has_many through" to set up a many to many association between Post and Category models.
    - `rails generate migration create_post_categories`
    - add two integer ids with timestamps in the table

  Note that you'll need a model backed join table to do this. You'll need to
    - modify the database schema
    - set up the associations in the models. Verify via rails console that this worked, 
      and that you can assign categories to posts, and iterate through a category's posts
      and vice versa (iterate through a post's categories).
      
## 8. Add routes for posts
  Put `resources :posts` in your routes.rb file.

  Go into terminal and type `rake routes` to verify that all 7 routes are created. 
  Prevent the 'delete' route from being accessed, since we won't have the ability to delete posts in our application.

  You can now also navigate your browser to "localhost:3000/rails/info" to see routing information. 
  Note that you need to start the rails server first.

## 9. Add PostsController
  Create a PostsController that can handle the index and show routes.
  - display all the posts in index. `@posts = Post.all`
    * create index page view for all the posts. Each post should have title, description,
      creator name, created at and comments link
    * add post's categories in the view, it should be above the title
  - add `show` method in the controller
    * create individual post view
  - extract common codes to partials 

## 10. Complete Post Actions
  Create all the typical actions for the Post resource (index, show, new, create, edit, update).
  Use model backed forms. 
  Add a validation and make sure the validation fires and display on the template.
  
  Extract that template to a partial. The partial is actually being used by 4 actions: new, create, edit and update.
    - keep in mind that view templates' dependencies(mostly, instance variables) must be set up correctly 
      in all actions that render that template. Be aware of the edge cases.
    * `new_record` is an ActiveRecord method that we can call and see if the object is new in database

## 11. New Category form
  Create a new category model-backed form, with validations.
  You'll need to add a route, create controller/actions and view templates.
  Extract the post into post partial.
  
  Since both the new category and post forms display validation errors, extract that bit of template code 
  to a partial, so you can reuse that logic
  * pass the obj object for different objects

## 12. New comment
  On the show post page, display a model backed comment creation form.
    - create a newsted resource to support a nested comment creation url (eg, HTTP POST request to /posts/:post_id/comments)
    - create a newsted model backed form view with validations
    - create a CommentsController#create action, remember to set up parent object
    - render back to the form submitted from when the new comment can't be saved

## 13. Select categories on new/edit post form & Show Category
  1. On the post form, expose either a combo box or check boxes to allow selection of categories for this post.
  - Hint: use the category_ids virtual attribute. It will return array format like [1, 2]
  
  2. Show Category page
  - After your posts are associated with categories, display the categories that each post is associated with.
  - When clicking on the category, take the user to the show category page where all the posts associated with that category are displayed
